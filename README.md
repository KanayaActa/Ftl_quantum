## Attention

Qiskit updates frequently, so many tutorials and resources can quickly become outdated.
Always refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/) for the most up-to-date information.
A major update is scheduled for **July 1, 2025**, which will deprecate some legacy features.

Let me know if you'd like to mention specific deprecated features like `ibm_quantum` channel or `IBMQ.get_provider`.
